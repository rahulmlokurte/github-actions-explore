### [GitHub Actions with Terraform](./github-actions-with-terraform/)
This will set up a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a Terraform module using Terraform cloud.
The GitHub Actions workflow will:
- check for the format of the Terraform module.
- It initializes the Terraform environment and validates the Terraform module.
- It will generate a Terraform plan for every pull request.
- It will apply the Terraform plan to the Terraform environment when we update the main branch.
